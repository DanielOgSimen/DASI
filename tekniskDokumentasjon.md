    npm start
    ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Architecture
DASI GPT is built using the following technologies:
- **Svelte Kit**: A modern framework for building web applications. Svelte Kit is used for the frontend of DASI GPT, providing a reactive and efficient user interface.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability. TypeScript is used throughout the project to ensure type safety and improve developer productivity.
- **OpenAI**: The core of DASI GPT's functionality is powered by OpenAI's GPT models. These models are used to generate natural language responses and perform various AI-driven tasks.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system used to store and manage data. MySQL is used for persistent storage of user data, application settings, and other relevant information.
- **Linux**: The operating system on which the application is deployed. Linux provides a stable and secure environment for running the application.
- **Git**: A version control system used to manage the project's source code. Git enables collaboration, version tracking, and efficient code management.
- **Markdown**: A lightweight markup language used for writing documentation. Markdown is used to create the project's technical documentation and other text-based content.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used in the project. JavaScript is used for both frontend and backend development, enabling dynamic and interactive functionality.

### Components
1. **Frontend (Svelte Kit)**
   - **UI Components**: Reusable and modular components built with Svelte Kit to create the user interface. These components handle user interactions and display data.
   - **Routing**: Svelte Kit's built-in routing system is used to manage navigation within the application. It provides a seamless user experience by enabling client-side routing.
   - **State Management**: Svelte's reactive stores are used to manage the application's state. This ensures that the UI is always in sync with the underlying data.

2. **Backend (TypeScript & Node.js)**
   - **API Endpoints**: The backend exposes a set of RESTful API endpoints that the frontend interacts with. These endpoints handle requests, process data, and return responses.
   - **Business Logic**: The core functionality of the application is implemented in the backend. This includes processing user inputs, interacting with the OpenAI API, and managing data.
   - **Database Integration**: The backend communicates with the MySQL database to store and retrieve data. This includes user information, application settings, and other relevant data.

3. **OpenAI Integration**
   - **GPT Models**: The application integrates with OpenAI's GPT models to generate natural language responses. This involves sending requests to the OpenAI API and processing the responses.
   - **AI-driven Features**: Various features of the application are powered by AI, such as text generation, language translation, and more.

4. **Database (MySQL)**
   - **Schema Design**: The database schema is designed to efficiently store and manage data. This includes tables for users, settings, logs, and other entities.
   - **Data Access**: The backend uses an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library to interact with the MySQL database. This provides a high-level abstraction for database operations.

5. **Deployment (Linux)**
   - **Server Configuration**: The application is deployed on a Linux server. This includes configuring the web server, database server, and other necessary services.
   - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Git and other CI/CD tools are used to automate the deployment process. This ensures that new changes are tested and deployed efficiently.
